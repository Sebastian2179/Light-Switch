------ VERSION PICKER ------
The "version picker" is the default index for the https://sebastian2179.github.io/Light-Switch website.
It's good because it lets you pick a version. (WHAAT??)

------ PC VERSION ------
The PC version does not work directly on the Github website, as it will ignore the sizing directions and resize to fit the screen. In order to bypass this, the version picker loads the html directly, which is why it takes longer.
The PC version will not always be up to date, since the game is intended for mobile.
The PC version is exactly the same as the mobile version except that it does not resize to fit the screen, since it would be absolutely diabolical to look at if it did.
It is not recommended to run the mobile version on PC as you will be unable to look at it.

------ WATCH VERSION ------
The watch version is intended to run in the Apple Watch web browser. I suggest sending the link to yourself and opening it on your watch. It does not have any online features since they do not work on Apple Watch.
If you want to skip the picker on watch, you should send this link to yourself: https://sebastian2179.github.io/Light-Switch/watch.html
