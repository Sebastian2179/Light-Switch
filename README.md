The PC version will not always be up to date, since the game is intended for mobile.
The PC version is exactly the same as the mobile version except that it does not resize to fit the screen, since it would be absolutely diabolical to look at if it did.
It is not recommended to run the mobile version on PC as you will be unable to look at it.
The watch version is intended to run in the Apple Watch web browser. I suggest sending the link to yourself and opening it on your watch. It does not have any online features since they do not work on Apple Watch.
